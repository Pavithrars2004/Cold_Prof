# Cold_Prof

**Cold_Prof** is a simple and efficient Chrome Extension that helps students write professional and polite emails to professors for various academic purposes — like requesting projects, internships, research opportunities, or mentorship.

This is a **personalized version** of an existing open-source tool. I chose this project because it solves a real-world student problem, and I’ve adapted it to match my own use case and preferences.
